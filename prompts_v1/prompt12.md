Role: Product engineer.

Task: Add an optional ChatPage (ChatPage.tsx + ChatPage.styles.ts) that:

- lets user choose scope (personal/professional/both)
- translates chat requests into calls to existing endpoints (digest/events search)
- displays citations and “sources used”
- never claims data from unlinked apps

Deliverables:

- Chat request/response types
- UI skeleton with styles file only
- Guardrails and empty-state messaging

Constraints:

- Chat is secondary.
- No new backend storage patterns.
